I've had some experience with oils and varnishes in the past and now bought some genuine shellac flakes. To me, shellac feels overrated, but more on that below.

I guess there's no point [going over the obvious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac): shellac is a natural finish with a cult following. It certainly has some advantages, but it is not going to be my finish of choice.

### Pros

Shellac dries quickly. Scratch that, it dries amazingly quickly. It becomes dry to the touch after a few minutes.

There is no smell apart from the alcohol that the flakes are dissolved in. This is a significant advantage over my usual oil-varnish blend, let alone polyurethane. I'll mention here that shellac is also food safe, but to me that makes no difference.

### Cons

Shellac does not polymerize, which means it can be dissolved once it's hardened. To me, this is the dealbreaker. Sure, no polymerization means shellac can be partially repaired, but I don't want a finish that can be ruined with alcohol or other common solvents.

I don't like the color - much too yellow for my taste, almost orange. I prefer red and brown tones or no color at all when the wood is bleached white.

It's a good thing I bought only a small bag. I guess I might use it as a primer or a sealant, or maybe to finish something that will hang on the wall and see little use. Or maybe I will change my mind in the future. At least the flakes have a shelf life measured in years, if not decades.

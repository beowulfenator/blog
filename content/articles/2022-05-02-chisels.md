I recently got a set of vintage blue-handled Stanley 5002 chisels and sharpened them. For now, they live in a tin can, and until I make a proper box for them, they rattle around and get dull. Having watched a few Youtube videos on saddle-stitching leather, I decided to give it a go and make these improvised sheaths or scabbards for the chisels.

Turns out that common household tools can get the job done, but it's not fun at all. The pyramid-tipped woodworking awl makes undesired incisions in the leather. A conical awl with a more acute point would work better. It's hard to push the needle through, and now the needle is bent. The thread? Well, it was the best combination of thickness and strength that I had on hand. And how much easier it would have been, if I had the special fork-like tool that makes a row of evenly-spaced holes to put the thread through.

At least the chisels fit. I actually rough-cut the leather first, then made the seams, then trimmed the edges again. Overall result? Satisfactory.

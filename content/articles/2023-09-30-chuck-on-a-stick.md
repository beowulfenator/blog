I typically use my cordless drill for drilling small holes and deburring them. However, there are times when I prefer to hold the drill bit in my hand, especially when I need to remove a burr or delicately clean out a hole. This simple tool is the solution to this problem.

The concept is uncomplicated: a standard drill chuck is attached to a handle. In my case, it's a keyless chuck designed for use with impact drills. The chuck came with an SDS adapter, which I've permanently affixed to the handle. The chuck itself can now be mounted onto the handle, and a small left-hand screw inside the chuck securely holds it in place.

I've prepared some walnut blanks for my turning projects. Among them, I have set aside several blanks that I consider the best, as they consist entirely of heartwood without any sapwood. This particular blank could be seen as training material because it's contains both heartwood and sapwood. Nevertheless, the contrast between the heartwood and sapwood in this board is not particularly pronounced, so I don't feel bad about using it for a project.

This project marked one of my initial attempts on my new lathe and served as a learning experience. The skew chisel still eludes me, but the gouge is relatively easy, even for a complete beginner. While the surface finish left by the gouge leaves much to be desired, a hard wood like walnut can be easily smoothed through sanding.

If I could redo this project, I would certainly make the handle longer. Unfortunately, I had initially cut this blank with a plane knob in mind. I utilized its full length, minus the parts that were used for securing the blank in the lathe, and yet it turned out to be too short.

One aspect I particularly appreciate about this project is the finish. I first coated the handle with a penetrating oil-varnish blend and then applied several coats of thinned-down varnish, the same type I used in the [router plane build](/2023/03/29/router-build-2/). The resulting satin finish is beautiful and durable.

title: Fitting Handles To Files

It all began with the need to rip and resaw boards, really. With no good options available, I am reduced to making my own ripping saw, or at least re-filing the teeth on a vintage crosscut saw. Fortunately, new old stock triangular files are abundant, because nobody wants them. But before I can use them, they need handles.

Making handles without a lathe is possible, but not fun at all (see [scrub plane makeover](/2022/08/05/scrub-plane-complete/)), but I happen to have some that I've acquired over time on various occasions. They all seem to be turned from beech, which is the go-to material for handles. Beechwood handles are not going to win beauty contests, but they make up for it in hardness and durability.

The ferrules on these handles are flimsy and more decorative than functional. It's unlikely they would hold the wood together were I to drive the tangs all the way in with a hammer.

Another option would be to heat up the tangs and drive them in hot, charring and compressing the wood in the process. I chose not to do that either because it's too cold outside and burning stuff indoors is not my thing.

So I went with epoxy. I've enlarged the holes for a loose fit, mixed some epoxy, and glued the files in. Of course, I underestimated the amount of epoxy needed and had to mix another batch. At least I got the proportions right, as after a night next to the heater the epoxy is fully cured.

I am unsure if these handles are meant to be disposable. They are certainly cheap and easy to fit. I guess if they were held by friction alone, one could easily replace the file. But then all tangs are different, so good luck getting a good connection the second time. We'll see when the time comes, but for now, I expect to discard the handles along with the worn-out files.
